MedChart is an Electronic Health Record.

The goal of this application is to provide students and instructors with an EHR
system that is accessible for educational purposes. This EHR has been designed to be
user friendly so that students will be able to learn how to best interview patients,
enter medical records, and practice patient safety and privacy.
